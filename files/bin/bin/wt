#
# This script provides a convenient wrapper around `git worktree` commands,
# simplifying common worktree operations such as creating, listing, removing,
# and pruning worktrees. It aims to streamline the workflow for managing
# multiple working directories for a single Git repository.
#
# Features:
# - `checkout <branch-name> [base-branch]`: Creates a new worktree for the specified branch.
#   If `base-branch` is provided, the new branch is based on it.
#   If the branch doesn't exist locally, it attempts to create it from `origin/<branch-name>`
#   or as a new, empty branch. If the worktree already exists, it provides a `cd` command.
# - `list`: Lists all existing git worktrees.
# - `remove <branch-name>`: Removes a specified worktree and its associated directory.
# - `prune`: Prunes (removes) stale git worktree entries.
#
# Dependencies:
# - `git` (specifically `git worktree` functionality).
#
# Usage:
#   wt <command> [arguments]
#
# Commands:
#   checkout <branch-name> [base-branch]  Create and checkout a new worktree for the specified branch.
#                           Example: `wt checkout feature/new-feature`
#                           Example: `wt checkout feature/another-feature main`
#   list                    List all existing git worktrees.
#                           Example: `wt list`
#   remove <branch-name>    Remove a specified worktree and its associated directory.
#                           Example: `wt remove old-feature`
#   prune                   Prune (remove) stale git worktree entries.
#                           Example: `wt prune`
