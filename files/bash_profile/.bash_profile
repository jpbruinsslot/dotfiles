# .bash_profile
#
# .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for
# interactive non-login shells. By either logging in with your username and
# password locally or ssh, the .bash_profile file is executed to configure
# your shell before the initial command prompt. But, if you're already logged
# into your machine and open a new terminal window then the .bashrc file
# is executed before the window command prompt.
